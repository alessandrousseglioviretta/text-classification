{"name":"Text-classification","tagline":"How to retrieve and classify text from various sources","body":"#Social media\r\n## Facebook comments\r\nFacebook's [Comment Box](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/) is a social plugin that allows users to add comments to web content. For example, have a look at [Barack Obama's Plan](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151435566046749) on Facebook, which has received, at the time of writing, over 25'000 comments.\r\n\r\nClearly, reading thousands of comments one by one is not a viable solution to the problem of social media monitoring. I'm going to show how to retrieve and automatically classify Facebook comments. In this example, I'm going to use Python, a widespread general-purpose, high-level programming language. See more on the [wiki](https://github.com/alessandrousseglioviretta/text-classification/wiki/Social-media-analytics:-Facebook-comments).\r\n\r\n## RSS feeds from Google Alerts\r\n[Google Alerts] enables the creation of automatic email updates of the latest relevant Google results based on your queries. The updates are also offered as RSS feed. If the number of results is too large, you might want to filter the updates so to get only those that fit some additional criteria. With the [Ghib.li](http://ghib.li) classification engine, you can train a classifier to filter the news feed according to your wishes.\r\n\r\n ","google":"UA-38691001-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
