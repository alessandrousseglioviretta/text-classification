{"name":"Text-classification","tagline":"How to retrieve and classify text from various sources","body":"# Facebook comments\r\nFacebook's [Comment Box](http://developers.facebook.com/docs/reference/plugins/comments/) is a social plugin that allows users to add comments to web content. For example, have a look at [Barack Obama's Plan](http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151435566046749) on Facebook, which has received, at the time of writing, over 25'000 comments.\r\n\r\nClearly, reading thousands of comments one by one is not a viable solution to the problem of social media monitoring. I'm going to show how to retrieve and automatically classify Facebook comments. In this example, I'm going to use Python, a widespread general-purpose, high-level programming language.\r\n\r\n## Get the comments\r\nFacebook's comments are displayed in web browser in a human-friendly way, but they are also publicly available in a computer-friendly format called [JSON](http://www.json.org/). To retrieve them, we need to find out the Facebook-ID of the object (in our case, the image with President Obama's plan) to which the comments are attached. The URL of the image is the following: `http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=10151435566046749`. The Facebook ID is the long number that follows `fbid=`. If you now compose the following URL: `https://graph.facebook.com/comments/?id=10151435566046749`, you'll get a long list of comments in the following format:\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n      \"id\": \"10151435566046749_...\",\r\n      \"from\": {\r\n          \"name\": \"...\",\r\n          \"id\": \"...\"\r\n          },\r\n      \"message\": \"...\",\r\n      \"can_remove\": false,\r\n      \"created_time\": \"2013-02-20T08:01:23+0000\",\r\n      \"like_count\": 0,\r\n      \"user_likes\": false\r\n}\r\n```\r\nComments in this data format can be easily retrieved and parsed by using a few lines of Python:\r\n```python\r\nimport requests\r\nimport simplejson as json\r\n\r\nFACEBOOK_GRAPH_COMMENTS_URL = 'https://graph.facebook.com/comments/'\r\nparams = {'id': '10151435566046749', 'limit': 10}\r\n\r\nresponse = requests.get(FACEBOOK_GRAPH_COMMENTS_URL, params=params)\r\ncomments = response.json()\r\n```\r\nThe comments object contains the latest 10 comments.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
